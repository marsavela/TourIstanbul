    <!-- Phrasebook -->


    <!-- Do\'s and Don\'ts -->
    <string name="when_visiting_a_mosque_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>remove your shoes before going inside a mosque.Women must cover hair and dress modestly. Men should not wear shorts.</string>
    <string name="when_visiting_a_mosque_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> talk loudly – it’s a place of worship. Try to avoid visiting a mosque on a Friday since it is a day of prayer.</string>
    <string name="when_visiting_a_mosque_child3">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>walk directly in front of someone who’s praying or, according to their belief, his prayer won’t be counted.</string>

    <string name="when_travelling_during_ramadan_child1">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> offer people food, drink or even a smoke during the day. The month of Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting, when devout Muslims refrain from eating and drinking from dawn until dusk. Show some courtesy while eating in public during the day.</string>
    <string name="when_travelling_during_ramadan_child2">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>be aware that it might be difficult to find food during the day in remote villages. Shop ahead.</string>

    <string name="when_visiting_traditional_rural_areas_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>wear more conservative clothing outside of large cities. Shorts and short sleeves are still acceptable, though.</string>
    <string name="when_visiting_traditional_rural_areas_child2">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>be aware that in rural areas where people are more conservative, men and women are expected to behave very modestly when showing any form of affection toward the opposite sex.</string>
    <string name="when_visiting_traditional_rural_areas_child3">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> be offended, if you are a female travelling with a male companion, when Turkish men talk only to your companion. They are not being rude but rather protective of your honour.</string>
    <string name="when_visiting_traditional_rural_areas_child4">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b>, if you are a male, talk or sit next to a single, young Turkish woman. She might feel threatened.</string>

    <string name="when_interacting_with_turks_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>learn gestures of the head for “yes” and “no”, which can be very confusing. “Yes” is a downward nod of the head and no is an upward nod of the head while raising eyebrows and clicking the tongue. Shaking your head might not be understood as “no”. Try to learn the Turkish words evet (yes) and hayir (no).</string>
    <string name="when_interacting_with_turks_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> make the “OK” sign with your thumb and forefinger. It’s considered obscene in Turkey.</string>

    <string name="when_talking_to_turks_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>be polite. Turkish customs place great emphasis on manners and politeness. It might come in handy to memorize some phrases or at least the words tesekkür ederim (thank you), lütfen (please) and pardon (excuse me).</string>
    <string name="when_talking_to_turks_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> berate Kemal Atatürk. Turkish people have a deep respect for the Founding Father of the Turkish Republic, and they wouldn’t tolerate even a harmless joke about him, much less any form of derogatory discussion about his achievements.</string>

    <string name="when_eating_in_a_restaurant_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>tolerate that abstinence from alcohol is greatly encouraged in Turkey as in many other Muslim countries. Although some Turks consume an occasional glass of wine – being drunk is considered a disgrace.</string>
    <string name="when_eating_in_a_restaurant_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> blow your nose or pick your teeth while sitting in a restaurant, cafe or bar. Turkish people find this just as impolite as burping openly. Go to the bathroom if you have to blow your nose or if something is stuck between your teeth.</string>
    <string name="when_eating_in_a_restaurant_child3">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>be aware that smoking while eating is common and you shouldn’t request your dining partners to stop.</string>
    <string name="when_eating_in_a_restaurant_child4">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> attempt to split the bill – it’s not traditionally done in Turkey. Pay for the whole meal if you initiated the invitation. If someone else pays, be sure to invite that person out to a meal in return before you leave Turkey.</string>

    <string name="when_invited_to_someones_home_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>take off your shoes before entering a home.</string>
    <string name="when_invited_to_someones_home_child2">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>bring a modest gift. Keep in mind that many Muslims adhere to an abstinent lifestyle – a bottle of alcohol is thus not an ideal gift. Giving money is considered rude.</string>
    <string name="when_invited_to_someones_home_child3">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> show the bottom of your feet to anyone when sitting down. Since it is quite common to sit on cushions or carpets on the floor, try to sit cross-legged or with your legs to one side.</string>
    <string name="when_invited_to_someones_home_child4">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>finish your plate. If you leave food on your plate, it is seen as a sign that you didn’t like the dish and risks offending your host.</string>

    <string name="when_shopping_at_a_bazaar_child1">&lt;b>Do &lt;/b>bargain. It’s regarded as a polite gesture and a form of dialogue to negotiate the price before buying. But:</string>
    <string name="when_shopping_at_a_bazaar_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> start to bargain if you’re not willing to buy the product in question. If the merchant gives you a price and you tell him yours in return, you have automatically entered into a business transaction.</string>
    <string name="when_shopping_at_a_bazaar_child3">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> buy stones or fossils. They are considered cultural artefacts and it’s illegal to export them. You could be forced to pay a fine or even end up in jail if caught going through customs with stones or fossils in your luggage.</string>

    <string name="when_taking_photos_child1">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> take pictures of people without asking permission. Older people, in particular, are afraid of the camera and consider it “the evil eye”.</string>
    <string name="when_taking_photos_child2">&lt;b>Don’t&lt;/b> take pictures of any woman wearing a veil, people praying, or any kind of military facility.</string>

    <!-- History -->
    <string name= "history0"> Across the country, there are thousands of archeological sites, historical places and ancient cities, as well as magnificent scenic spots and natural wonders. Since Roman times, Asiatic Turkey has been known as both "Asia Minor" and "Anatolia". The European part of Turkey is called Thrace. </string>
    <string name= "history1"> These lands have been continually inhabited since the Stone Age. Because Anatolia is located like a natural bridge between continents, no other country in the world has acquired so many historical treasures. </string>
    <string name= "history2"> The Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus form the western boundaries of the Anatolian peninsula. Beside the Dardanelles are the ruins of the famous city of Troy — a memento of thousands of years of history- and on the shores of the Bosphorus rises Istanbul in all her beauty and splendor, keeping the memories of her past alive.  </string>
    <string name= "history3"> There are many legends related to the foundation of Istanbul. According to the best known one, around 650 BC, a sea tribe from the Aegean left their city Megara and began to look for a new homeland under the leadership of Byzas. </string>
    <string name= "history4"> According to the customs of the age, before any such undertaking an oracle had to be consulted. The oracle in the Apollo temple in the famous town of Delphi advised Byzas to settle opposite the "land of the blind". The migrants searched for such a land for a long time. When they came to the headland of present-day Istanbul, they were delighted with the fertile lands and the advantages offered by the natural harbor, the Golden Horn. They also noticed the people living across the stretch of water. The migrants decided that those people must have been blind if they could not appreciate the opportunities of this ideal place and settled on the opposite shore, and they were convinced that they had found the land the oracle had described. </string>
    <string name= "history5"> Excavations have revealed finds dating back to the 3rd millennium BC at the tip of the Golden Horn and on the Asian side. </string>
    <string name= "history6"> The city of Byzantium existed as an independent state, but succumbed from time to time to the superior powers ruling the region. The acropolis of the city stood where Topkapi Palace stands today. It had a well-protected harbor, still used today, in the Golden Horn. A fortified city wall starting here surrounded the city and reached the Sea of Marmara. Byzantium was an important seaport and a center of trade under the Roman Empire. However, it sided with the wrong party during a struggle for the throne in 191 AD, and after a siege that lasted two years, it was conquered and razed by the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus. The same emperor later reconstructed the city on a larger scale. New city walls were built and the city was adorned with new buildings.</string>
    <string name= "history7"> By the 4th century AD the Roman Empire had expanded considerably, and the capital Rome lost its central position in the empire. While looking for another city as his new capital, the Emperor Constantine the Great finally chose Istanbul, realizing the strategic position of the city at the intersection of sea and land routes and the importance of its perfect climate.</string>
    <string name= "history8"> New city walls were constructed, enlarging the city again, and numerous temples, governments, palaces, baths and a hippodrome were built.</string>
    <string name= "history9"> Finally in 330 AD it was officially declared the capital of the Roman Empire. Many ceremonies were organized for the occasion, which marked the beginning of a golden age. Although the city was initially called the Second Rome or New Rome, these names were soon forgotten to be replaced by "Byzantium" and in later ages by "Constantinopolis", while the people favored the name "Polis". </string>
    <string name= "history10"> The successors of Constantine the Great continued to improve and beautify the city by building new avenues, aqueducts, monuments and edifices. The first churches in the city were also built after the time of Constantine. </string>
    <string name= "history11"> The Roman Empire was divided into two in 395 AD. Although the Western Empire collapsed in the 5th century, the Eastern Empire, which was administered from the capital, Istanbul survived for over 1,000 years afterwards. </string>
    <string name= "history12"> This empire was named as the Byzantine Empire by modern historians. Byzantium had a very interesting history, because its development was influenced both by the earlier Anatolian civilizations and, more importantly, by Christianity; its laws and rules were adopted from Rome, but its pomp and ceremonies from the East. </string>
    <string name= "history13"> The city was enlarged once more with the erection of new city walls in the first half of the 5th century. The magnificent city walls on the landward side that we see today were built by Emperor Theodosrus If. They are 6,492 m long. In the 6th century, the city, that now had a population of over half a million, lived through another golden age during the reign of Emperor Justinian. The famous Hagia Sophia is the work ot this emperor. </string>
    <string name= "history14"> The later history of the Byzantine Empire and its capital Istanbul is filled with palace and church    intrigues and Persian and Arab attacks. The throne frequently changed hands after bloody feuds between royal families. Between 726-842, all kinds of religious images were outlawed in the city during the iconoclastic movement. This led to much destruction (and much concealment) of  paintings and statues.</string>
