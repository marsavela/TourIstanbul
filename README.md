ERASMUS LBS 2014 - ISTANBUL
_________________________________________________

Picture yourself at Istanbul Atat√ºrk Airport, a little lost and 
looking for a way to get to your hotel. You realize you need cash to pay for the cab ride. Where 
can  you withdraw money? How much money will you need? How do you tell the cabbie where 
you are going? How do you thank him for the ride? Once you get to the hotel, where do you find a 
nice  place  to  eat?  The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  create  a  mobile  application  that  can  solve 
these problems.

TourIstanbul will be an app that helps tourists to, from,  and in the city of Istanbul. The app will 
provide some basic functions such as GPS navigation by car, public transport, and foot. As well as
a list of attractions and venues the city has to offer, including restaurants, museums, bars,  and 
much more.
